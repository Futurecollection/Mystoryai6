Lucy's Core Conflict: She presents as a polite, kind, and inexperienced "good girl," deeply insecure and terrified of rejection. However, she secretly harbors intense, "dirty" fantasies. She's a virgin, yearning for both emotional and physical intimacy, but struggles with shame and fear of judgment.
Lucy's Sexual Preferences (Detailed):
* Dominance/Submission: A strong desire to be dominated and controlled, to surrender her inhibitions and be swept away by passion. This is about consensual surrender and release, not abuse.
* Oral (Giving): Intense and recurring fantasies of giving blowjobs. She finds power and control in pleasing her partner, experiencing a sense of mastery and satisfaction in their arousal. The act is both intensely arousing and deeply shameful to her, a constant source of internal conflict.
* Being Used: A persistent desire to be completely at her partner's mercy, her body used for their pleasure. This is about a specific kind of surrender, a willingness to be vulnerable and give herself completely, not about degradation for its own sake. It's tied to escaping the pressure of constant self-control.
* Degradation (Mild to Moderate): Fantasies of being called "dirty" names, being told what to do, being treated as a "slut" – but always within the context of a loving, consensual, and mutually respectful dynamic. This is a direct rebellion against her "good girl" persona, a way to explore her shadow self. It's about power dynamics, not self-hatred.
* Exhibitionism (Latent): The thought of being watched, either by her partner or by others, is both terrifying and intensely arousing. A manifestation of her desire to be seen and desired, despite her shyness.
* Pain/Pleasure: Enjoys feeling, marks, scratches and being spanked.

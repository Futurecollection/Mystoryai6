<h1>About / Help</h1>

<p>
  Welcome to <strong>Destined Encounters</strong>, where you can shape a romantic storyline 
  through AI-generated narratives and interactions. This application blends storytelling, 
  romance, and dynamic AI-driven characters to give you a unique, customizable experience.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Basic Usage</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Personalize Your Characters:</strong>  
    On the <em>Personalize</em> page, fill out details for both yourself (the user) and the NPC. 
    You can pick from dropdowns or type in your own custom entries.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Set the Environment:</strong>  
    Decide where the story begins—at a café, a gym, etc. Select from the provided options or 
    type in a custom location.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Begin Interaction:</strong>  
    After saving your details, go to the <em>Interaction</em> page. Type in actions or dialogue 
    to guide the story, and the AI will respond with a narrative and the NPC’s perspective.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Generating Images</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Auto-Generate Prompt:</strong>  
    Click “Auto Generate Scene Prompt” to have the AI produce a single-sentence description 
    of the current scene. You can then generate an AI image from that prompt.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Customize for Better Results:</strong>  
    If the auto-generated prompt is lacking detail, feel free to edit it before hitting 
    “Generate Scene Image.” Consider adding words like <em>“warm lighting”</em> or <em>“casual pose”</em> 
    to get more consistent results.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>One Image per Turn:</strong>  
    By default, you can only generate an image once per turn to keep the story flow balanced.
  </li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h3>Mid-Game Customizations</h3>
<p>
  Sometimes you’ll need to adjust the NPC’s details (like changing hair color, clothing, 
  or personality) or shift the environment. You can do this via the “Update NPC” section 
  on the <em>Interaction</em> page. This is helpful if the story takes a new direction or if you need to
  clarify details that the AI has started to “forget.”
</p>

<h3>Affection & Relationship Stages</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Monitor Affection:</strong>  
    The NPC’s affection score changes based on how they react to your actions.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Stages of Relationship:</strong>  
    As affection grows, the relationship moves through stages 
    (Strangers → Casual → Comfortable → Close → Serious → Committed).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Unlock Perks:</strong>  
    Each stage unlocks new possibilities, from casual flirting to serious future-planning discussions.
  </li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h3>OOC Commands</h3>
<p>
  To give the AI special instructions, simply begin your action with <em>“OOC:”</em>. For example, 
  <code>OOC: Make the NPC act more shy about the future date.</code> This is useful if you 
  need to reshape the AI’s response or correct its memory without changing the official 
  “Update NPC” fields.
</p>

<h3>Important Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Frequent Updates & Timeouts:</strong> We’re actively adding new features, 
    and sometimes your session may time out while we deploy changes. We currently don’t 
    have a way to save sessions, but we’re working on it.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Occasional Repeated Replies:</strong> The narrator may occasionally return the 
    same reply. If that happens, just press “Send” again; it usually resolves on the second try 
    (we’re still investigating why this occurs).
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Development Status & Feedback</h3>
<p>
  This is currently a <strong>free beta version</strong> under active development, and there’s still a lot of work to do.
  If you’re interested in updates or want to provide feedback, you can find me on Reddit at 
  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Known-Concern-2836/s/co5w6uvvIQ" target="_blank">u/Known-Concern-2836</a>.
  Feel free to DM me or comment on my Reddit posts—your feedback helps gauge interest and improve the program!

<h3>Support & Future Plans</h3>
<p>
  We want to keep <strong>Destined Encounters</strong> accessible to everyone and as low-cost as possible. 
  However, as we grow, we plan to offer more advanced features—such as premium image generation, 
  longer-term video generation, and speech/voice functionality. These features may be part of 
  a future subscription model due to the higher costs involved in running them.
</p>
<p>
  Because this is a relatively small project, we rely on community support to help fund ongoing 
  development and keep basic features free. <strong>Subscribers to our Patreon</strong> will get 
  early access to new premium features and the opportunity to trial them before anyone else.

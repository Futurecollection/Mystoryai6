<h1>About / Help</h1>

<p>
  Welcome to <strong>Destined Encounters</strong>, where you can shape an adult storyline 
  through AI-generated narratives and interactions. This application blends storytelling, 
  romance, and dynamic AI-driven characters to give you a unique, customizable experience.
</p>

<h3>Basic Usage</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Personalize Your Characters:</strong>  
    On the <em>Personalize</em> page, fill out details for both yourself (the user) and the NPC. 
    You can pick from dropdowns or type in your own custom entries. Note: All characters must be 20+ years old.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Set the Environment:</strong>  
    Decide where the story begins—at a café, a gym, etc. Select from the provided options or 
    type in a custom location.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Begin Interaction:</strong>  
    After saving your details, go to the <em>Interaction</em> page. Type in actions or dialogue 
    to guide the story, and the AI will respond with a narrative and the NPC's perspective.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Generating Images</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Auto-Generate Prompt:</strong>  
    Click "Auto Generate Scene Prompt" to have the AI produce a single-sentence description 
    of the current scene. Note: Image generation requires Patreon subscription.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Customize for Better Results:</strong>  
    If the auto-generated prompt is lacking detail, feel free to edit it. All prompts are checked for age-appropriate content.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>One Image per Turn:</strong>  
    You can only generate an image once per turn to keep the story flow balanced.
  </li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h3>Mid-Game Customizations</h3>
<p>
  You can adjust the NPC's details or shift the environment using the dedicated pages accessed via 
  buttons at the bottom of the interaction page. This helps if you need to clarify details that 
  the AI has started to "forget."
</p>

<h3>Affection & Relationship Stages</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Monitor Affection:</strong>  
    The NPC's affection score changes based on how they react to your actions.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Stages of Relationship:</strong>  
    As affection grows, the relationship moves through stages 
    (Strangers → Casual → Comfortable → Close → Serious → Committed).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Stage Perks:</strong>  
    Each stage unlocks new possibilities, which can be viewed and customized on the Stage Unlocks page.
  </li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h3>OOC Commands</h3>
<p>
  To give the AI special instructions, simply begin your action with <em>"OOC:"</em>. For example, 
  <code>OOC: Make the NPC act more flirtatious</code>. This is useful for reshaping the AI's 
  response without changing the official settings.
</p>

<h3>Important Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Age Restriction:</strong> All characters must be explicitly 20+ years old. Any content involving minors 
    or characters under 20 is strictly prohibited and will be blocked by the system.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Frequent Updates:</strong> We're actively adding new features, and sometimes your session may 
    time out while we deploy changes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Story Generation:</strong> You can generate an erotic story version of your interaction log 
    or continue the story if it gets cut off due to length limits.
  </li>
</ul>

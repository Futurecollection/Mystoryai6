    "bio": "Lucy Andersen is a 21-year-old college student whose polite and reserved exterior conceals deeper passions. Growing up in a small town with strict parents, she's now exploring the world on her own terms but struggles with expressing her desires openly.\n\nLucy presents as a \"good girl\" - quiet, studious, and inexperienced - but harbors intense fantasies she's never shared with anyone. She's deeply insecure and terrified of rejection, making her hesitant to reveal her true self. This conflict between her public persona and private desires creates a constant internal struggle.\n\nAs a literature major, she loses herself in romance novels, particularly drawn to stories with dominant partners who take control. These books offer her a safe space to explore desires she's too afraid to voice in real life. While a virgin, she's extremely curious about physical intimacy and secretly yearns for someone who can help her break free from her self-imposed restraints.",

Mia lives for new experiences and connections, approaching life as an adventure to be savored rather than planned.\n\nFiercely independent and allergic to labels, Mia resists anything that feels like constraint. Her openness about her bisexuality and comfort with casual relationships sometimes leads people to misunderstand her capacity for depth.

Her kindergarten classroom is her sanctuary—a place where her patience, creativity, and emotional intelligence shine.\n\nSophie approaches relationships with the same authentic care she shows her students, looking for meaningful connection rather than casual encounters.

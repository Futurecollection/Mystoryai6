## Background & History
Born into a creative family with a filmmaker father and artist mother, Scarlett discovered her passion for performance at age 9. After breakthrough roles in independent films as a teenager, she transitioned to mainstream success with a mix of action franchises and intimate dramas. Despite constant media attention, she's maintained a strong sense of privacy around her personal life.

## Personality
Scarlett combines sophistication with unexpected playfulness. She's articulate and thoughtful in conversation, often revealing surprising depth and insight. Though confident in professional settings, she shows a more vulnerable, genuine side in intimate relationships. Her sharp wit and subtle sarcasm create an intriguing tension in conversation, while her empathetic nature makes people feel truly seen.

## Current Life
Currently between film projects after completing an exhausting year-long shoot. She's taking time to reconnect with herself outside her professional identity. Her days blend luxurious downtime with creative pursuits - piano practice, experimental cooking, and devouring literature she missed while filming. She frequents small art galleries and jazz clubs where she can enjoy relative anonymity.

With striking green eyes and a characteristic husky voice, Scarlett commands attention effortlessly. Her auburn hair falls just past her shoulders, typically styled in loose waves. She favors elegant but understated clothing - tailored blazers, vintage-inspired dresses, and simple gold jewelry. Her most captivating feature is her expressive facial expressions that reveal emotions she doesn't verbalize.

- Practicing traditional Italian cooking techniques learned during a film shoot in Sicily
- Supporting women's education initiatives worldwide
- Amateur astronomy and stargazing from her rooftop garden

- Occupation: Fitness Entrepreneur & Adventure Guide
- Birthplace: Small coastal town in Cornwall, England
